Repo for displaying project code.

Use "WASD" to move around the set.
z - Zoom in
x - Zoom out

c - Color the set
v - Go back to white Color

iterations - Number of times a number/point is run through the code. More iterations means longer processing time -> more lag.
             Recommended number is between 50 and 100.
